        <div class="updated">Last updated November 24, 2025</div>

        <p>
          This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>Moms Connect</strong>
          ("<strong>Company</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>,"
          and "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to
          recognize you when you visit our website at
          <a href="https://new-city-connect.replit.app" target="_blank"
            >https://new-city-connect.replit.app</a
          >
          (the "<strong>Website</strong>"). It also explains what these
          technologies are, why we use them, and the choices you have to control
          their use.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or
          information that becomes personal information if we combine it with
          other details.

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners to make their websites work, to work more efficiently,
          and to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Moms Connect) are
          called <strong>first-party cookies</strong>. Cookies set by parties
          other than the website owner are called
          <strong>third-party cookies</strong>. Third-party cookies enable
          third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
          website (for example, analytics and performance tools). The parties
          that set these cookies can recognize your device when it visits our
          Website and when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are required for
            technical reasons in order for our Website to operate. They enable
            core functionality such as user login, session management, and
            security. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot
            be provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance and analytics cookies:</strong> These cookies
            help us understand how the Website is being used, such as which
            pages are visited most often and any errors users might encounter.
            This information is used to improve how our Website works and how we
            deliver our services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Third parties may serve cookies through our Website for
          <strong>analytics and performance purposes only</strong>. We
          <strong>do not</strong> use third-party advertising cookies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
          Because essential cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with
          our services, they cannot be disabled. For non-essential cookies, you
          can control and manage them through your browser settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to block or delete certain cookies, some features of the
          Website may not function properly or be available.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>How to manage cookies in your browser</h2>
        <p>
          The way you can manage cookies depends on the browser you are using.

        <h2>Other tracking technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors. We may
          use similar technologies from time to time, such as web beacons (also
          known as clear gifs or tracking pixels). These are tiny graphics files
          that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when
          someone has visited our Website or opened an email that we have sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies help us monitor traffic patterns, measure the
          success of certain features, and improve overall performance. Many of
          these technologies rely on cookies, so disabling cookies may impair
          their function.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
        <p>
          We do not intentionally use Flash cookies (also known as Local Shared
          Objects or "LSOs") on our Website. However, older browser plugins or
          content on other websites you visit may use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to limit or disable Flash cookies, you can adjust your
          Flash Player settings using Adobe's tools. Please note that limiting
          Flash cookies may reduce the functionality of some Flash-based
          content.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>No.</strong> We do not use targeted advertising,
          interest-based advertising, or retargeting technologies on our
          Website. No third-party advertisers deliver ads through our Website or
          App. Any third-party cookies used in connection with our Website are
          limited to analytics, performance, and basic site functionality.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes
          to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory
          reasons. Please revisit this page regularly to stay informed about our
          use of cookies and related technologies.
